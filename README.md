# Data Science Learning Plan

## Why?
In september I am going to start a course in machine learning in order to improve my skills with complex tasks that need to be solved with advanced programming techniques (a.k.a. artificial intelligence).

The problem is that due to `life` I have skipped Module I of that course and now need to get up to speed in order to not fall behind.

The purpose of this repo is to store the work done to get the necesary level.

## How?

This repo will contain exercises in the following areas:

- Data Cleaning
- Linear Regression
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Dimensional Reduction
- Temporal Series

The idea is to work through a set of tutorials to get get basic introductory skills.
